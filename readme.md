# IRLibCP -- a Circuit Python Module for Receiving, Decoding and Sending Infrared Signals.

IRLibCP is copyright 2017 by Chris Young. It it is translation of the original IRLib2 written in C++ by Chris Young. See COPYRIGHT.txt for details.

This is an extremely early beta release. Much further documentation, example code, and module refinement is necessary.

There is a preliminary users manual in .docx and PDF formats in the docs folder.

**NOTE: This module depends on the Circuit Python "pulseio" module which is only available on the "Express" versions of Adafruit boards. Specifically Circuit Playground Express, Feather M0 Express, and Metro M0 Express. Other implementations of Circuit Python such as regular Feather M0 Basic or BLE or ESP 8266 do not support pulseio and therefore these modules will not work on those platforms.**
